<h2>AGAINST PRIDE IN CLOTHES.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why should our garments, made to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our parents' shame, provoke our pride?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The art of dress did ne'er begin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Eve our mother learnt to sin.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When first she put the covering on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her robe of innocence was gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet her children vainly boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the sad marks of glory lost.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How proud we are! how fond to shew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our clothes, and call them rich and new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the poor sheep and silkworms wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That very clothing long before!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tulip and the butterfly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear in gayer coats than I:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me be dress'd fine as I will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flies, worms, and flowers exceed me still.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then will I set my heart to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inward adornings of the mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge and virtue, truth and grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are the robes of richest dress.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No more shall worms with me compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is the raiment angels wear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Son of God, when here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put on this blest apparel too.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It never fades, it ne'er grows old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fears the rain, nor moth, nor mould:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It takes no spot, but still refines;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more 'tis worn, the more it shines.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In this on earth would I appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then go to heaven, and wear it there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God will approve it in his sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis his own work, and his delight.<br /></span>

<h2>THE SLUGGARD.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis the voice of the Sluggard: I heard him complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'You have waked me too soon! I must slumber again!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the door on its hinges, so he on his bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turn his sides, and his shoulders, and his heavy head.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A little more sleep, and a little more slumber!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he wastes half his days and his hours without number;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he gets up he sits folding his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or walks about sauntering, or trifling he stands.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I pass'd by his garden, and saw the wild brier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thorn, and the thistle grow broader and higher;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clothes that hang on him are turning to rags;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his money still wastes, till he starves or he begs.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I made him a visit, still hoping to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had took better care for improving his mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told me his dreams, talk'd of eating and drinking;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he scarce reads his Bible, and never loves thinking.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Said I then to my heart, 'Here's a lesson for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man's but a picture of what I might be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thanks to my friends for their care in my breeding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who have taught me by times to love working and reading!'<br /></span>

<h2>THE ANT, OR EMMET.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">These Emmets, how little they are in our eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We tread them to dust, and a troop of them dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Without our regard or concern:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as wise as we are, if we went to their school,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's many a sluggard and many a fool<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some lessons of wisdom might learn.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They wear not their time out in sleeping or play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gather up corn in a sunshiny day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And for winter they lay up their stores:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They manage their work in such regular forms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One would think they foresaw all the frosts and the storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And so brought their food within doors.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But I have less sense than a poor creeping Ant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I take not due care for the things I shall want,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor provide against dangers in time:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When death or old age shall once stare in my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What a wretch shall I be in the end of my days,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If I trifle away all their prime!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now, now, while my strength and my youth are in bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me think what shall serve me when sickness shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And pray that my sins be forgiven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me read in good books, and believe, and obey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, when death turns me out of this cottage of clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I may dwell in a palace in heaven.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>INNOCENT PLAY.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Abroad in the meadows, to see the young lambs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Run sporting about by the side of their dams,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With fleeces so clean and so white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or a nest of young doves in a large open cage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they play all in love, without anger or rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">How much may we learn from the sight!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If we had been ducks, we might dabble in mud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dogs, we might play till it ended in blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So foul and so fierce are their natures;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Thomas and William, and such pretty names,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should be cleanly and harmless as doves or as lambs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those lovely sweet innocent creatures.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not a thing that we do, nor a word that we say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should injure another in jesting or play,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For he's still in earnest that's hurt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How rude are the boys that throw pebbles and mire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's none but a madman will fling about fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And tell you "'Tis all but in sport!"<br /></span>
</div>

<h2>AGAINST EVIL COMPANY.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why should I join with those in play<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In whom I've no delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who curse and swear, but never pray;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Who call ill names, and fight?<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I hate to hear a wanton song:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their words offend my ears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should not dare defile my tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With language such as theirs.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Away from fools I'll turn my eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor with the scoffers go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would be walking with the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That wiser I may grow.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From one rude boy, that's used to mock,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They learn the wicked jest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sickly sheep infects the flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And poisons all the rest.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My God, I hate to walk or dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With sinful children here:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let me not be sent to hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Where none but sinners are.<br /></span>

</div>

<h2>THE THIEF.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why should I deprive my neighbor<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of his goods against his will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hands were made for honest labor,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Not to plunder, or to steal.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis a foolish self-deceiving<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By such tricks to hope for gain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that's ever got by thieving<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Turns to sorrow, shame, and pain.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Have not Eve and Adam taught us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Their sad profit to compute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what dismal state they brought us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When they stole forbidden fruit?<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oft we see a young beginner<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Practise little pilfering ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till grown up a harden'd sinner,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then the gallows ends his days.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Theft will not be always hidden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though we fancy none can spy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we take a thing forbidden,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">God beholds it with his eye.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guard my heart, O God of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Lest I covet what's not mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest I steal what is not given,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Guard my heart and hands from sin.<br /></span>
</div>
</div>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>THE ROSE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How fair is the Rose! what a beautiful flower!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The glory of April and May:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the leaves are beginning to fade in an hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And they wither and die in a day.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet the Rose has one powerful virtue to boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Above all the flowers of the field!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When its leaves are all dead and fine colors are lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still how sweet a perfume it will yield!<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So frail is the youth and the beauty of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though they bloom and look gay like the Rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all our fond care to preserve them is vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Time kills them as fast as he goes.<br /></span>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then I'll not be proud of my youth and my beauty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Since both of them wither and fade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But gain a good name by well doing my duty:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This will scent like a Rose when I'm dead.<br /></span>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
